== Introduction ==

I dug around looking for answers to some of the questions regarding how libraries are linked into projects. Here is what I have found.

== Libraries ==

The library source is located at 
   ../Microchip/MPLAB C32 Suite/pic32-libs/

The library peripheral source is located under:
   ../Microchip/MPLAB C32 Suite/pic32-libs/peripheral 

I looked at the make files for these and here are some observations.
  * The makefiles were compiled under linux/unix and use extensive use of bash.
  * All the libraries in pic32-libs are linked into chip specific .a files located at 
   ../Microchip/MPLAB C32 Suite/pic32mx/lib 
  * The pic32mx/includes folder is identical to the same in pic32-libs (this is the 'source' it was created from)     
 
== Linking ==

I still haven't found information on how the linker decides what to include or not. 

The libraries .c code is separated in function-per-file chunks as we discussed last Tuesday.
